## Feature Usage Guidelines

This template provides many features to make development easier. However, not all features are necessary for every project. Below are recommendations on when to use each one:

### Routing (React Router)

- Use for multi-page or multi-route apps.
- If building a simple single-page app, you can remove or reduce routing complexity.
- Named routing works best for SEO or when you need route-based metadata (e.g., dynamic blog pages).

### SEO with PageHelmet

- Ideal for public-facing apps that need search engine visibility.
- In small internal tools, you can remove it if SEO is not required.

### Mock Service Worker (MSW)

- Use when you need to mock or simulate API requests during development or tests.
- If your app has no API calls or you have full backend coverage from the start, MSW can be removed.

### Theme System (Dark/Light Modes)

- Applies consistent styles across the app and allows easy theme switching.
- If the project does not require a dark mode or theme customization, you can remove the `ThemeContext` and simplify the CSS variables.

### Breadcrumbs

- Helpful if you have nested routes or want users to navigate deeper pages more easily.
- Can be removed for flat or very simple navigation structures.

### Lazy Loading

- Improves performance by splitting code into smaller chunks.
- Recommended for larger apps, but can be skipped in small projects with minimal code.

### MSW Initialization Command

- If you use MSW to intercept requests at path `'/'`, you must run:
  ```
  npx msw init ./public --save
  ```
  once for each new project or whenever you re-create the `/public` folder.

# Vite + React + TypeScript Template with ESLint & Prettier

This template provides a consistent starting point for frontend projects built with Vite, React, and TypeScript. It integrates ESLint and Prettier to enforce code quality and style consistency across multiple development environments.

## Features

- **Vite**: A fast and modern build tool for development.
- **React + TypeScript**: Scaffolding for React projects with TypeScript support.
- **ESLint**: Configured with support for React, TypeScript, and Prettier integration.
- **Prettier**: Ensures consistent code formatting.
- **EditorConfig**: Standardizes indentation, line endings, and other settings across editors.
- **Ready-to-Use Folder Structure**: Simplifies project setup.

## ESLint Configuration

This template includes a robust ESLint setup using the Flat Config format. The configuration supports:

- The latest ECMAScript features (`ecmaVersion: 'latest'`).
- TypeScript linting using `@typescript-eslint/parser` and `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`.
- React-specific linting with `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` and `eslint-plugin-react-refresh`.
- Prettier integration via `eslint-plugin-prettier`, ensuring formatting issues are reported as ESLint errors.
- Pre-configured rules for React and TypeScript development.

## Prettier Configuration

The template includes a `.prettierrc` file with the following settings:

```json
{
  "semi": true,
  "singleQuote": true,
  "trailingComma": "es5",
  "arrowParens": "always",
  "printWidth": 80,
  "tabWidth": 2
}
```
````

Prettier is seamlessly integrated with ESLint, so all formatting issues are reported during linting.

Here's the updated **How to Use** section along with the **Scripts**:

### Setting up Blackbox for File Encryption

To securely encrypt sensitive files in this project using **StackExchange Blackbox**, follow these steps:

#### 1. Install `BlackBox`

You can automatically install StackExchange Blackbox via the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/StackExchange/blackbox.git
cd blackbox
sudo make copy-install
```

This will copy the necessary files into `/usr/local/bin`.

#### 2. Obtain the Encoded GPG Keys

The **public** and **private** Base64-encoded GPG keys are stored in the repository's "Secrets."
Ask the project maintainer to share the keys with you if you do not have access yet.

You will receive:

- A **Base64-encoded public key**
- A **Base64-encoded private key**

#### 3. Import the Public Key

Once you receive the **Base64-encoded public key**, use the following command to decode and import it:

```bash
echo "base64_encoded_public_key" | base64 --decode | gpg --import
```

- Replace `base64_encoded_public_key` with the actual Base64-encoded string of the public key.

#### 4. Import the Private Key

After importing the public key, you'll also need to import the **private key** for decryption purposes. To do that, use the following command:

```bash
echo "base64_encoded_private_key" | base64 --decode | gpg --import
```

- Replace `base64_encoded_private_key` with the actual Base64-encoded string of the private key.

#### 5. Verify the Import

You can verify if both keys were successfully imported with the following command:

```bash
gpg --list-secret-keys
```

This will list the GPG keys on your system, and you should see both the public and private key associated with your GPG email.

#### 6. Decrypt Files with `BlackBox`

With both the public and private keys imported, you can now decrypt the files in your project:

```bash
blackbox_decrypt_all_files
```

This command will decrypt all files that were encrypted with Blackbox, using your imported GPG keys.
